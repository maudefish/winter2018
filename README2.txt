JUNE 7, 2017:

deviation_analysis2.py saves all of the data (without summing/averaging over all text files) so I can just choose the radius/radii i want to look at. 

question: could I look at a 3d version of this? or contour/grid plots?

the real question: how quickly do the Q's and sigmas tend towards a particular value??
